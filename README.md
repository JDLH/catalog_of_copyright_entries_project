# Catalog of Copyright Entries Project
NYPL Project to transcribe and parse pages from the US Catalog of Copyright Entries

The New York Public Library (NYPL) is embarking on a pilot project to extract the data from a publication known as the Catalog of Copyright Entries, published annually by the United States Copyright Office. The volumes have already been digitized and are [freely available through the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/copyrightrecords); our project aims to extract and parse the data contained in the records in order to create a searchable database that will aid copyright research.
